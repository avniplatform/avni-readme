title: Developing BI dashboards using AI services
excerpt: >-
  The AI in Reporting feature simplifies SQL query generation for reports using
  AI models. Report requirements developed in excel format can be input as CSV,
  and AI service can generate SQL queries and other reporting artifacts. This
  reduces manual coding and creates efficient, standardised reporting queries.

<Callout icon="❗️">
  This is no longer the recommended approach, please refer to [Simplification of reports development and testing](https://avni.readme.io/docs/simplification-of-reports#/) section
</Callout>

The tool used for this is Cursor which internally uses other AI services. You can download [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/).

The source code used in this tool is available here [avni-ai-experiment](https://github.com/avniproject/avni-ai-experiment) (private repository as the CSV files used in the context may contain customer specific information). This repository will become a public repository soon.

# Generate aggregate and line list query

### When to use

Excel or spreadsheet contain the requirements for the report all present in a single sheet. This is the input used for generating the SQL. If you do not have this file then the steps below are **not recommended** as it will not be productive approach.

### Setup

1. Open avni-ai-experiment in Cursor.
2. Download the requirement sheet as a CSV file. Copy its contents and put them in any file under `bi-reporting-spike/dataset/workspace` folder. Let's say - `requirement.csv`. An example is present in workspace folder by name `example.csv`.
3. Create one file which contains all the table definition in the `bi-reporting-spike/aggregate/workspace`  or `bi-reporting-spike/linelist/workspace` folder. Let's say - `table-def.sql`. An example is present in workspace folder by name `example-jnpct-def.sql`. This was generated from IntelliJ (select schema and generate).

### Chat

1. Open chat window in Cursor.
2. Prompt to forget everything (line 1 of `aggregate-query-prompt.md` or `linelist-query-prompt.md`)
3. Follow the steps in [https://github.com/avniproject/avni-ai-experiment/blob/main/bi-reporting-spike/aggregate/workspace/aggregate-query-prompt.md](https://github.com/avniproject/avni-ai-experiment/blob/main/bi-reporting-spike/aggregate/workspace/aggregate-query-prompt.md) or [https://github.com/avniproject/avni-ai-experiment/blob/master/bi-reporting-spike/linelist/workspace/line-list-prompt.md](https://github.com/avniproject/avni-ai-experiment/blob/master/bi-reporting-spike/linelist/workspace/line-list-prompt.md)
